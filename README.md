# planets
A gravity simulation using a 3D rendering engine written in Python
Using this program you can create and simulate planetary systems on your computer. It can be used in schools for teaching and students can experiment with it themselves.

I wrote this program as a high school project for the German Arbitur in 2013 and originally released in on [Sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/planets-sk/). Due to this the help documents and code comments are in German.

## Requirements:
- Python 2.7
